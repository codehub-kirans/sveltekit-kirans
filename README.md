This is my personal website built with HTML, CSS(SASS), Javascript and SvelteKit!

Code is open-sourced - _so feel free to fork and customize for your own content!_

## Uses

- ⚡️ **Super fast static site generation with hydration**. Every route is compiled down to static HTML and routed with (optional) JavaScript, thanks to the SvelteKit static adapter (pre-installed)
- 📦 **Zero-config preloading** for automatic, fast background preloading of all top-level pages
- ✍️ **Markdown support** (_with my own posts_)
	- 📑 **Pagination** included (_can customize posts per page_)
	- ✅ **Category pages** included
	- 💬 **Posts JSON API**
- 💅 **Sass** pre-installed and configured
- 📝 **mdsvex** pre-installed--use Svelte components inside Markdown!
	- 🔗 **Rehype** plugins are included to generate unique heading IDs, for direct linking
- 📱 **Responsive and accessible defaults**; includes a "skip to content" link and accessible mobile nav menu
- 🔄 **Page transitions** (_fancy!_)
- 🔎 **Basic SEO** for blog posts
- 📰 **RSS feed** set up and ready to go (_though it could also likely benefit from some optimization_)
